Portfolio Website (HTML, CSS, Python-Flask)
Developed a clean and responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects.
The website is built using HTML and CSS for the frontend and Python (Flask) for routing and handling contact form submissions.
This project demonstrates my understanding of web design principles, Flask routing, file structuring, and GitHub version control.

Key Highlights:
Designed a user-friendly UI with consistent layout
Built modular pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
Managed routing using Flask
Maintained code in a structured GitHub repository
Shows hands-on experience in web development
